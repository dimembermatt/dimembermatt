### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm [Matthew Yu](https://dimembermatt.github.io/), an Electrical and
Computer Engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin. My focus is
on embedded systems, but I like to take detours and have worked with everything
from web development to [generative
art](https://dimembermatt.github.io/Generative_Art/).

I was a software intern at Cisco (Summer 2019), Qualcomm (Summer 2020, 2021),
and Relativity Space (Fall 2020). I'm currently interning at Apple for Summer
2022 as a hardware intern. I've also TA'd for my embedded systems lab course
under Professors Mark McDermott and Jonathan Valvano in Fall 2021 and Spring
2022, and will do so again for Fall 2022.

I have been and still am a passionate and active member in several UT
organizations, including:
- Longhorn Racing Solar
- Texas Rocket Engineering Lab
- IEEE Robotics and Automation Society

I'm currently working towards graduating with a Master's degree in embedded
systems in Fall 2023, but am also looking for great opportunities to be close to
hardware, building tangible, sustainable, and helpful devices and experiences
for other humans. 

Here's a (not very short) shortlist of my current interests:
- EMI inspection and reduction using RF arrays
- Electroadhesion-based robotic movement
- Hardware DfT and DfM best practices
- DC-DC converter characterization
- MPPT algorithms and solar array simulation

if any of these topics interest you, or if you just want to learn more about
me!
