### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm [Matthew Yu](https://dimembermatt.github.io/), an Electrical and
Computer Engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin. My focus is
on embedded systems, but I like to take detours and have worked with everything
from web development to [generative art](https://dimembermatt.github.io/Generative_Art/).

I was a software intern at Cisco (Summer 2019), Qualcomm (Summer 2020, Summer 2021), and
Relativity Space (Fall 2020). I am currently a teaching assistant for EE445L (Embedded 
systems design lab, Fall 2021, Spring 2022) at UT.

I am also an active member and leader in UT's Longhorn Racing Solar team, the Texas Rocket 
Engineering Lab, and the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. At the end of the day, these
organizations require a lot of personal investment, but my passion for these orgs, what they 
represent, and their end goals drive me to keep doing my best every day.

I'm currently working towards graduating with a Master's degree in embedded systems in 
Spring 2023, but am also looking for great opportunities to be close to hardware, 
building tangible, sustainable, and helpful devices and experiences for other humans. 
At the moment I'm very interested in EMI, DfT, and DfM best practicies for PCBs.

Feel free to contact me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimembermatt/) 
if any of these topics interest you, or if you just want to learn more about
me!
