### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm [Matthew Yu](https://dimembermatt.github.io/), an Electrical and
Computer Engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin. My focus is
on embedded systems, but I like to take detours and have worked with everything
from web development to [generative art](https://dimembermatt.github.io/Generative_Art/).

I was a software intern at Cisco (Summer 2019), Qualcomm (Summer 2020, Summer 2021), and
Relativity Space (Fall 2020). I am currently a teaching assistant for EE445L (Embedded 
systems design lab) at UT.

I am also a constantly active member and leader in UT's Longhorn Racing Solar
team, the Texas Rocket Engineering Lab, and the IEEE Robotics and Automation
Society. A couple of the organization projects I have a hand in are listed below!

- Designing and manufacturing solar powered systems.
- Developing Maximum Power Point Tracker hardware and software, with a research
  focus on new MPPT algorithms for multistring photovoltaics.
- Writing the codebase for TREL's Mission Control System application software.
- Interfacing a robot swarm and mothership for outreach.
- And codirecting IEEE RAS' yearly freshman robotics competition.

All of these different projects are tricky to juggle and involve a lot of
personal investment, but my passion for these orgs, what they represent, and
their end goals drive me to keep doing my best every day.

I'm currently applying for a Master's in embedded systems for Spring 2022, but am 
also looking for great opportunities to be close to hardware, building tangible, 
sustainable, and helpful devices and experiences for other humans.
